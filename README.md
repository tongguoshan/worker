### **Introduction**

Lag[i] (Landing AGI) is a solution designed by Beijing Landing Technologies Co.,Ltd. specifically for the significant gap between the powerful forces of the large model open-source community and enterprise application deployment. It is an enterprise-level composite multimodal large model middleware aimed at bridging this gap, by providing a secure and professional platform, enabling enterprises to customize and deploy large models in a low-cost, efficient manner.

### Quick Start

For developers, we provide a simple way to compile and run the Lag[i] (Landing AGI) application. You can choose to use the Maven command-line tool to package, or run it through mainstream Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like IntelliJ IDEA. Please ensure your JDK version meets at least the requirements of version 8.

#### Method 1: Using Maven Command

First, you need to clone the Lag[i] (Landing AGI) project repository and switch to the project directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/landingbj/lagi.git
cd lagi
```

Next, modify the [`src/main/resources/lagi.yml`](lagi-web/src/main/resources/lagi.yml) configuration file, replace the large language model API_KEY or SECRET_KEY with your own keys, and set the `enable` field of the model you wish to activate to `true` as needed. Detailed configuration methods can be seen in the [configuration documentation](docs/config_en.md).

```yaml
- name: gpt-test
  type: GPT
  enable: true
  priority: 1
  model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
  api_key: your-apikey
```

Then, use the Maven command to package the project, and the packaged war file will be generated in the `target` directory:

```shell
mvn package
```

Finally, deploy the generated war package to the Tomcat server. After starting Tomcat, you can view the specific page of Lag[i] (Landing AGI) by accessing the corresponding port through a browser.

#### Method 2: Using IDE

If you prefer to use an IDE for development, you can directly open the Lag[i] (Landing AGI) project with mainstream IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA. After publishing the project as a web project to the Tomcat server, you can view the interface of Lag[i] (Landing AGI) by accessing the respective port through a browser.

### Tutorial

### Extension

If you are not satisfied with the adapted large model for Lag[i] (Landing AGI), you can also refer to our [Extension documentation](docs/extend_en.md) to extend Lag[i] (Landing AGI), adapting it to your preferred large model. This document not only covers the methods for adapting and extending functional models and vector databases but also provides expansion examples to help you quickly grasp the methods for extending Lag[i] (Landing AGI), meeting your specific requirements.

If you find the vector databases currently integrated with Lag[i] (Landing AGI) to be less than satisfactory for your needs, you can also refer to our [Extension documentation](https://github.com/landingbj/lagi/blob/main/docs/extend_en.md#Database-Extension) to expand Lag[i] (Landing AGI) and adapt it to your preferred vector database. This will meet your diverse business requirements, enhance the overall performance and reliability of your system, and provide a more enriching and efficient data management experience.

### Security

To better integrate Lag[i] (Landing AGI) into your business,You can do this by adding the keywords you want to filter in the  [`sensitive_word.json`](lagi-web/src/main/resources/sensitive_word.json) file,In the [priority_word.json](lagi-web/src/main/resources/priority_word.json) file, you specify which keywords to answer first.And set the stop keyword in the [stopping_word.json](lagi-web/src/main/resources/stopping_word.json) file,Thus, the returned results of the dialogue are changed, the dialogue is guided in a specific direction, and the dialogue is automatically stopped when needed.

Example: 

Set the sensitive word filter, level has three values, 1: delete the entire sentence when the sensitive word is matched 2: replace with mask 3: erase (default). mask: mask string (default :...) . rules: represents a list of sensitive rules, where rule for each list element represents the regular expression matching the sensitive word, mask and level are used globally if not specified:   

If `OPENAI` is successfully matched, the `OPENAI` is erased. If `hello` is successfully matched, the `hello` is replaced with `***`. If `people` is successfully matched, use `...` Substitution.

```json
{
  "mask": "...",
  "level": 3,
  "rules": [
    {"rule":"OPENAI"},
    {"rule":"hello", "level": 2, "mask": "***"},
    {"rule":"people", "level": 2}
  ]
}
```

Example：Set priority keywords and stop keywords:

```json
[
  "openai"
]
```
